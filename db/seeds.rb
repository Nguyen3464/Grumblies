    title: 'Mahi Mahi Tacos',
    ingredients: '2 medium limes
    3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
    1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more as needed
    1 teaspoon chili powder
    1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
    1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
    1 1/2 pounds skinless mahi-mahi (about 4 fillets), thawed if frozen
    1 ripe medium avocado
    1 small jalapeño
    1 clove garlic
    1/4 cup sour cream or full-fat plain Greek yogurt
    1/2 small head red cabbage, or 4 cups pre-shredded cabbage or coleslaw mix
    8 (6- to 8-inch) corn or flour tortillas
    Optional toppings: pico de gallo, fresh cilantro leaves',
    subsitution: 'cod, haddock, halibut, grouper, snapper',
    instructions: 'Finely grate the zest from 1 medium lime (about 2 teaspoons) into a medium bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil, 1 1/4 teaspoons of the kosher salt, 1 teaspoon chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika, and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and stir to combine.
    Cut 1 1/2 pounds mahi-mahi into 1 1/2 to 2-inch pieces. Add to the spice mixture and toss to coat. Set aside for about 15 minutes while you prepare the avocado sauce and slaw.
    Clean the cutting board. Juice the zested lime until you have 2 tablespoons, juicing the second lime as needed, and pour into the bowl of a regular or mini food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Cut any remaining lime into wedges for serving.
    Halve and pit 1 ripe medium avocado. Scoop the flesh from one half into the food processor. Place the remaining avocado half cut-side down until ready to serve.
    Trim and halve 1 small jalapeño crosswise. Scrape the seeds from one half, if desired, for a mild sauce, then add to the food processor. Cut the remaining half into thin rounds for serving.
    Add 1 garlic clove, 1/4 cup sour cream, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt to the food processor. Process until very smooth, 1 to 2 minutes, scraping down the bottom and sides of the bowl as needed. Transfer to a large bowl.
    Core and very thinly slice 1/2 small head red cabbage until you have 4 cups. Add to the avocado dressing and toss with tongs until coated. Taste and season with more kosher salt as needed.
    Warm 8 (6- to 8--inch) corn or flour tortillas one at a time by holding them directly over a medium flame on a gas stove, or in a skillet over medium heat on an electric stove, flipping occasionally, until charred in spots and pliable. (Alternatively, wrap the stack of tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave until warm, 20 to 25 seconds.) Stack together and wrap in a clean kitchen towel or aluminum foil to keep warm.
    Heat 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil to a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add half of the mahi-mahi in a single layer, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Cook undisturbed until the fish is browned and releases easily from the pan, about 3 minutes. Flip the fish and cook on the second side until browned and releases easily from the pan, and the fish is cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a clean plate. Repeat cooking the remaining mahi-mahi in the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil.
    Assemble the tacos: Peel and dice the remaining avocado half. Divide the mahi-mahi and slaw evenly among the warmed tortillas. Garnish with the avocado, jalapeños, and other optional toppings, if desired. Serve with the lime wedges for squeezing.',

    subsitution: 'beef, pork, fish',

    Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a large, heavy skillet until shimmering. Add the chicken and cook until cooked through and the juices run clear, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl.
    Heat 12 corn tortillas on a comal (a flat, round griddle) or, if you don’t have one, wrap a stack in a dishcloth (I count three tortillas per person) and warm in the microwave. Keep them warm by wrapping them tightly in an extra dishcloth, or put them in a tortilla basket (still in the cloth) or a tortilla warmer. Serve with the chicken and toppings.',

    title: 'Birria Tacos',
    ingredients: '3 1/2 pounds boneless beef chuck roast
    3 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more as needed
    1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
    4 dried guajillo chiles
    2 dried ancho chiles
    1 large white onion
    5 cloves peeled garlic
    1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger
    2 medium plum or roma tomatoes
    5 cups water
    1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
    1 teaspoon black peppercorns
    1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano
    1 teaspoon cumin seeds
    1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
    1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
    1/4 cup avocado, grapeseed, or canola oil
    5 cups beef broth
    tap here
    4 sprigs fresh thyme
    18 (about 6-inch) corn tortillas
    1 cup fresh cilantro
    2 medium limes
    1 pound Chihuahua, Oaxaca, or Monterey jack cheese, shredded (optional for quesatacos)',
    subsitution: 'lamb, pork, chicken',
    instructions: 'Cut and season the beef. Cut 3/12 pounds chuck roast into 12 pieces. Season with 2 teaspoons of the kosher salt and 1 teaspoon ground black pepper.
    Prepare the chiles, onion, and ginger. Using kitchen shears, cut the stems from 4 guajillo and 2 ancho chiles. Remove the seeds. Peel and halve 1 large white onion. Peel 1-inch fresh ginger and cut in half. Place the chiles, half the onion (reserve the other half of the onion), and ginger in a 6-quart or larger pressure cooker.
    Cook the aromatics. Add 5 peeled garlic cloves, 2 plum tomatoes, and 5 cups water. Using the highest Sauté setting, bring to a boil. Boil for 10 minutes.
    Blend the sauce. Turn off the cooker. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chiles, onion, garlic, tomatoes, and ginger to a blender. Add 2 cups of the cooking liquid, the remaining 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon black peppercorns, 1 teaspoon Mexican oregano, 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves. Blend on high speed until smooth, about 1 minute.
    Strain the sauce. Fit a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl. Strain the sauce and push it through the strainer with the bottom of a ladle until only a thick paste remains in the strainer. Discard the contents of the strainer.
    Sear the beef. Empty, wash, and dry the insert of the pressure cooker. Add 1/4 cup avocado oil to the pressure cooker and heat on the highest Sauté setting for 5 minutes. Add half the beef and sear until browned on a few sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Repeat searing the remaining beef.
    Pressure cook the beef. Return all the beef and any accumulated juices to the pressure cooker. Add the strained sauce, 5 cups beef broth, and 4 fresh thyme sprigs. Lock on the lid and make sure the valve is set to seal. Set to cook on HIGH pressure for 40 minutes. It will take 15 to 20 minutes to come up to pressure. Meanwhile, prepare the toppings.
    Prepare the toppings. Dice the reserved 1/2 onion. (If you’d like a less spicy onion, rinse under cold water.) Finely chop 1 cup fresh cilantro. Cut 2 limes into wedges. Shred 1 pound cheese if desired. Refrigerate in separate containers.
    Release the pressure naturally. When the cook time is up, let the pressure naturally release for 15 minutes. Quick release any remaining pressure.
    Shred the beef. Heat the oven to 250ºF. Using a slotted spoon, transfer all of the beef to a large bowl. Shred the beef with 2 forks, discarding any chunks of fat. Discard the thyme sprigs. Taste and season the beef and cooking liquid (consommé) with kosher salt as needed -- they should be very well seasoned.
    Dip the tortillas. Heat a griddle or large nonstick frying pan over medium heat (or about 350ºF on a griddle). Working with as many tortillas will fit in a single layer in the pan or griddle, dip the tortillas one at a time in the consommé. Place in the pan in a single layer.
    Fill the tacos. If making quesatacos (cheese birria tacos), sprinkle about 1/4 cup of the cheese onto each tortilla first. Top one half of each tortilla with about 1/4 cup shredded beef. Drizzle the beef with a little more consommé.
    Cook until crispy. When the cheese is melted, fold each tortilla in half. Cook, flipping halfway through, until browned in spots and crispy, 5 to 6 minutes total.
    Keep the tacos warm. Transfer the tacos to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Repeat assembling and cooking the remaining tacos. Serve the tacos garnished with the diced onion, cilantro, and lime wedges, with small bowls of consommé for dipping.',
